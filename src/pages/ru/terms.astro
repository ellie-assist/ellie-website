          </li>
          <li>
            Abuse, gaming, or attempting to mislead will result in your account

          </li>
          <li>
            No search engine ads, Facebook ads or any other ads that would
            compete with our own marketing and cause potential confusion for
            customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            No pretending to be acting on behalf of us (ie. as an employee).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to change the Terms of Service for our affiliate

          due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to
          use the materials on Squarecat's website, even if Squarecat or a
          Squarecat authorized representative has been notified orally or in
          writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions
          do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
          liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations
          may not apply to you.
